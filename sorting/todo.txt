I have heap sort and quick sort (apparently) working for i32.

Next steps?

- Add testing for the algorithms via Unit Tests
- Add some tests utilizing randomized input that validates correctness. 
  This may be difficult given I have used arrays though and I don't seem to be able to instantiate them dynamically.

Performance
- Some performance tests would be really great. It would be good to understand how to benchmark a rust application

Extensions
- Revisit Traits and understand how I can introduce an icomparable type interface (ala C#) into rust
- Implement my sorting algorithms for c
